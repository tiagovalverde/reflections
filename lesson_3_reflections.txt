When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I would want to create a remote repository to be able to work with other people on the same project. This way everyone have always the latest version of the project. Having the code in a remote repository makes it more flexible to be accessed. Also, it can be used as a measure of backing up our work.
