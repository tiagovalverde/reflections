How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It makes faster to locate the lines changed in the file, therefore, easy
    to locate the typos. There is no need to scroll through the entire file.
    It is a time saver

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will be easy to track down the changes made through the history of the
    file. It is always easy to undo something that went wrong. Imagine access
    a snippet of code you programmed a month ago but you did not bk that file.
    There is also the possibility to view who changed a file.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It reduces the amount of versions of a file, therefore easier to look for
    a specific version. When created manually we know a significant portion 
    of code was written that will differentiate the files significantly.

    In Google Docs it creat a big number of versions and a bif percentage is no meaningful. The only advantages is the automatic backups made.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because in a project developing a app, game or website, some files are dependent on other to work properly. For example a website with a htl file is dependent on the css and js files to work correctly.
    In google docs the file have no relation to each other. Changing one file does not affect the others.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log 
    lists all the commits made throughout the project history
    indicate commit id, author, date and message

    git diff commitid commitid
    compares two files and tell us the the lines andded and removed btw the two files.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    With version control you can try new things withouth being afraid of creating a bug or breaking the code. If something went wrong you can always go back to previous versions and compre the differences.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    use git for a new project to be able to get experience and work with the version control.
